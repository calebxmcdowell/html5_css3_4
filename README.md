# Murach's HTML5 and CSS3 (4th Edition) Student Download

## Book Applications (book_apps)
Most of the chapters end with an application that demonstrates what the chapter has presented. Students are expected to run these applications and review all of the code to see how they work.

Chapters 3-19 end with applications that build on the Town Hall website. There are no textbook applications for chapters 12, 16, 17, and 19.

## Exercise Starts (exercises)
Exercises at the end of each chapter help students master the skills that are taught in each chapter. For each exercise, students start from folders and files that contain some of the code that the exercise requires. Exercises guide the students through the process of building several pages of a website. These exercises force students to use all of the critical skills that are needed for website development.

## Exercise solutions (solutions)
To help students get over any learning obstacles when they're working on their own, check the solutions to see how something is done. 

## chapter 1 - Introduction to web developement
Before we started chapter one, I imagined all aspects of a webpage being designed through only a few lines of code and in a single language. I now realize that it is CSS, HTML, and Java script all working together. I have learned that CSS is used for styling where as HTML is used for structuring. A cascading style sheet can be used inside of a HTML document to style things like the background color or font and text size of a webpage. HTML has diferent elements and atributes to form the foundation and structure within the page. HTML contains the head (Meta, Title, and Link tag) and body (h1, Image tag, paragraph tag, and Anchor tag) element of a webpage. Both the head and the body have child elements. The child elements have sibling elements that can also have child elements. The head is not visible to the user and the body element is. Both branch out to complete the form of what we see on a given webpage. CSS uses properties such as margin and padding to organize what the user sees. Margin controls the space outside of an element and padding controls the space on the inside of an element. Together they can be used size, place and arrange elements.
